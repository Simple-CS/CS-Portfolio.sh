    <p> Hello! My name is Ethan Edelhart, and I am a student in<br>
    Mr. Hesby's Introduction to Computer Science Class. <br>
    I currently attend Summit Shasta High School in Daly City, CA,<br>
    and I am in the 10th grade.  </p>
   <br>
 <div id="CS"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/CSGO.jpg" alt="Counter Stike " width="250">
 <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/Poker_Chips.jpg" alt="poker chips" width="250" height="140"></div>
 <div class="right-side"> <p id="paragraph-index-2"> I am  a person who loves to travel, as I have been to the countries<br>
    of Singapore, England, Korea, Germany, France, and the Netherlands,<br>
among others. I also enjoy the activities of completing mathematics problems,<br> watching CS:GO,
and observing/learning poker. </p></div>
  <div id="twitch-img"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/twitch-to-livestream-the-e3-event.jpg?crop=0px%2C2px%2C600px%2C334px&resize=670%2C377" alt="Twitch Logo" width="520"></div>
   <p id="P-Twitch"> One of my favourite things in the world is <a href="https://twitch.tv" id="link-2">Twitch.tv</a>. This website,<br> 
   for those of you who don't know, is one in which users live stream<br> themselves playing video games or
   talking about some type of game<br> for viewers over the internet to watch/listen to. 
   The appeal of this site,<br> in my opinion, is the ability to be entertained while learning about<br> nearly
   any game at any time of day, from people all over the world.<br> I came across the webstie while 
   looking around <a href="https://youtube.com" id="link-1">YouTube.com</a>, seeing<br> that some content creators 
   were live streaming their videos. From that<br> point forward, Twitch  became one of the most essential 
   websites I have<br> ever had the pleasure of coming across. On a different note, one of my<br> favourite 
   foods is teriyaki chicken with rice, for the reason that it combines<br> my favourite type of meat with 
   my favourite side dish. When both foods<br> come together, it makes for an all around perfect meal. </p>
  <div id="music-notes"><img src="http://images.clipartpanda.com/hymn-clipart-ecMd9kpcn.png" alt="Music Notes" width="300"></div>
   <div class="right-side"> <p id="paragraph-index-4">One hobby which I enjoy partaking in is playing piano. I consider this<br> to be a hobby of mine becase
       it is something that I enjoy to do on a<br> regular basis, and it also began my love for music as a whole. 
       I have<br> been playing for nearly 6 1/2 years, and in that time I have become<br> better at not only playing 
       the instrument but also understanding the<br> art form that is music. In fact, at this moment, one of my 
       favourite<br> songs to both listen to and play is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Tr0otuiQuU" id="link-3">
        "Sonata Quasi una Fantasia (Moonlight Sonata)" </a><br> by Ludwig van Beethoven. On the other end of the
        musical spectrum, however, a song<br> I have been enjoying with increasing frequency is 
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlzQRLvMtMU" id="link-4">"On Me"</a> by The Game, with an<br> impeccable 
        feature of Kendrick Lamar. This song combines exquisite insturmentals<br> and thrashing, powerful lyrics. 
        OVerall, my taste in music is very versatile, and is a<br> massive part of who I am. </div>

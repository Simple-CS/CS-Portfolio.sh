    <h2>All About Me:</h2> 
    </div>    
    <p>Hello! My name is Ethan Edelhart, and I am a student in<br>
    Mr. Hesby's Introduction to Computer Science Class. <br>
    I currently attend Summit Shasta High School in Daly City, CA,<br>
    and I am in the 10th grade. <br>
    <br>

   <br>
  <p id="paragraph-index-2"> I am  a person who loves to travel, as I have been to the countries<br>
    of Singapore, England, Korea, Germany, France, and the Netherlands,<br>
among others. I also enjoy the activities of completing mathematics problems,<br> watching CS:GO,
and observing/learning poker. </p>

   <p> One of my favourite things in the world is <a href="https://twitch.tv" >Twitch.tv</a>. This website,<br> 
   for those of you who don't know, is one in which users live stream themselves playing video games or
   talking about some type of game for viewers over the internet to watch/listen to. 
   The appeal of this site, in my opinion, is the ability to be entertained while learning about nearly
   any game at any time of day, from people all over the world. I came across the webstie while 
   looking around <a href="https://youtube.com">YouTube.com</a>, seeing that some content creators 
   were live streaming their videos. From that point forward, Twitch  became one of the most essential 
   websites I have ever had the pleasure of coming across. On a different note, one of my favourite 
   foods is teriyaki chicken with rice, for the reason that it combines my favourite type of meat with 
   my favourite side dish. When both foods come together, it makes for an all around perfect meal. </p>

    <p id="paragraph-index-4">One hobby which I enjoy partaking in is playing piano. I consider this to be a hobby of mine becase
       it is something that I enjoy to do on a regular basis, and it also began my love for music as a whole. 
       I have been playing for nearly 6 1/2 years, and in that time I have became better at not only playing 
       the instrument but also understanding the art form that is music. In fact, at this moment, one of my 
       favourite songs to both listen to and play is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Tr0otuiQuU">
        "Sonata Quasi una Fantasia (Moonlight Sonata)" </a> by Ludwig van Beethoven. On the other end of the
        musical specturm, however, a song I have been enjoying with increasing frequency is 
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlzQRLvMtMU">"On Me"</a> by The Game, with an impeccable 
        feature of Kendrick Lamar. This song combines exquisite insturmentals and thrashing, powerful lyrics. 
        OVerall, my taste in music is very versatile, and is a massive part of who I am.

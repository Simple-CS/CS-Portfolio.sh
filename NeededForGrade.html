<h1>What is Vindinium?</h1>
<p id="vind1">Vindinium is a turn based online multiplayer game in which four competitors battle to acquire the most land, in the form of mines, <br> and by
doing so, get the most gold. Each player has one person, a hero, who they may move around the map. Players must move<br> around to the various
gold mines placed around the map, and try and take them over. These mines are protected by goblins, and once<br> the goblin is defeated, the 
mine is acquired. When a mine is owned, the owner receives one gold per round from each mine that they hold. <br> <br> Additionally, players 
have the ability to fight against one another, once a single turn is finished. If one hero kills another, and the player who was<br> killed had 
control of a number of mines, then the killer takes over the previously owned mines. Furthermore, if a player wants to regain health<br> which 
may have been lost during battle, they may pay a visit to the tavern. At the tavern, they will be able to buy a drink for the cost of 2 gold.<br> 
The drink will restore 50 health, at most, although they can purchase several drinks at a time. The player who was killed will return to their<br>
spawn point to respawn immediately the game ceases after 1200 total turns, and the winneris decided based upon the final amount of gold that<br>
players have.</p>

<div id="vind2"><p> A main goal of the creators of Vindinium was to have people develop unique bots to fight agianst one another. They did this by giving people
certain<br> specifications and guidlines that they needed to follow, and allowing them to design their own bots to fight with. This aspect creates 
really fierce competition.<br> Along with the elo system that works to rank players, Vindinium is a game which induces creativity and a competitive 
nature. </p></div>

<h1 class="head-text">How is the Bot Created </h1>

<h2 class="head-text"> Global Data</h2>
<p>The section which is commented under the title "Global Data" includes information that is needed
for the general well-being of your bot. By this, I <br>mean it includes information that will allow you
create meaningful subsets within your code, as well as introduce new variables into your code, based
upon<br> identifiers already existing in the game. The subset "Global Data" is depicted visually here:</p>
<code><pre> 
  /*                                      *
         * This Code is global data!            *
         *                                      */

        // Set myDir to what you want and it will set bot.goDir to that direction at the end.  Unless it is "none"
        var myDir;
        var myPos = [bot.yourBot.pos.x, bot.yourBot.pos.y];

        var enemyBots = [];
        if (bot.yourBot.id != 1) enemyBots.push(bot.bot1);
        if (bot.yourBot.id != 2) enemyBots.push(bot.bot2);
        if (bot.yourBot.id != 3) enemyBots.push(bot.bot3);
        if (bot.yourBot.id != 4) enemyBots.push(bot.bot4);

        var closestBot = enemyBots[0];
        for (i = 0; i < enemyBots.length; i++) {
            if (bot.findDistance(myPos, [closestBot.pos.x, closestBot.pos.y]) > bot.findDistance(myPos, [enemyBots[i].pos.x, enemyBots[i].pos.y])) {
                closestBot = enemyBots[i];
            }
        }
        //this code is included to have your bot find the nearest enemy bot. This is essential for attacks, although you can adjust as needed. 

        var trumpBot = enemyBots[0];
        for (i = 0; i < enemyBots.length; i++) {
            if (bot.yourBot.mineCount < enemyBots[i].mineCount) {
                trumpBot = enemyBots[i];
            }
        }
        // The purpose of this codeblock is to locate the bot with the most mines. Once that bot is located, my bot will  (hopefully) attack said bot. 
</pre></code>

<p> The first part of global data, which introudces the array "enemyBots", allows for constant identification of
enemies, no matter what bot number you are.<br> This is useful because it allows you to simplify the code you create 
later related to attacking certain enemies. </p>

<p> After that, there is code that introduces the variable "closestBot". As the name says, this variable is needed in order 
to have my bot find the bot that is<br> closest to it. This may be utilised for attacks when you just want to attack someone at
random, when no specific target is needed. </p>

<p> Finally, in this section titled global data, I have the variable "trumpBot". Although the name is slightly silly, it 
does actually relate to the function of the variable.<br> This variable's intention is to attack the bot which has control of
most mines, thus the name "trumpBot". This action is carried out by creating an if statement <br>which basically says that
if my mine count is lower than the enemies bot count, then the varialbe trumpBot needs to come into play. </p>

<h2 class="head-text"> What to Do</h2>

<p> The section titled "What to Do" within the code works to tell the bot in what order certain actions. For my bot, I 
wanted regenerating health and killing to be<br> the two main objectives. For this reason, I decided to have my "if" statement
tell the bot to heal, under certain parameters; in my situation, my bot will heal if their<br> health is lower than 30 or (the
two lines stand for Or) if my bot has more than 4 mines and (&&) an enemy is within 7 spaces. </p>

<pre><code>
      /*                                      *
         * This Code Decides WHAT to do         *
         *                                      */
        var task;
        task = "freemines";

        if (bot.yourBot.life <= 30 || bot.yourBot.mineCount > 4 && bot.findDistance(myPos, [closestBot.pos.x, closestBot.pos.y] <= 7)) {
            task = "kyrSp33dy";
        }
        else if (bot.yourBot.life >= 50 && bot.freeMines < 1) {
            task = "attacktheplebs";

        }
        else {
            task = "freemines";

        }

</code></pre>


<p> After that, the next action I want my bot to complete is an attack of other players. Since I will need my bot to
complete 3 actions, I will use an else if statement.<br> The parameters which I will have my bot follow for this istance is 
that they should attack enemy bots if my bot's life is greater than fifty and the number of free mines<br> is less than 1.</p>
    
<p> Finally, when every other actioon is complete, I Will have my bot look for free mines. This will allow it to obtain 
gold, and so my bot will become more wealthy with<br> this action. This set of text is run over and over again until the 
is complete. </p>    
    
<h2 class="head-text"> How to do it</h2>

        // This Code find the nearest freemine and sets myDir toward that direction //
        if (task === "freemines") {
            var closestMine = bot.freeMines[0];
            for (i = 0; i < bot.freeMines.length; i++) {
                if (bot.findDistance(myPos, closestMine) > bot.findDistance(myPos, bot.freeMines[i])) {
                    closestMine = bot.freeMines[i];
                }
            }
            console.log("Olofmeister, Boostmeister");
            myDir = bot.findPath(myPos, closestMine);
        }
        if (task === "kyrSp33dy") {
            var taverns = bot.taverns[0];
            for (i = 0; i < bot.taverns.length; i++) {
                if (bot.findDistance(myPos, taverns) >
                    bot.findDistance(myPos, bot.taverns[i])) {
                    taverns = bot.taverns[i];
                }
            }
            console.log("Sippin' on some lean");
            myDir = bot.findPath(myPos, taverns);
        }

        if (task === "attacktheplebs") {
            console.log("Pulverising the Pleberinos");
            myDir = bot.findPath(myPos, [trumpBot.pos.x, trumpBot.pos.y]);
        }

</code></pre>
    <p> This section of code is arguably the most important. As evident by the comment in the code at this very beginning, this
    section tells the bot how to do what it needs to.<br> The first small part relates to the gathering of free mines. In basic terms, 
    this code says that if the selected task is "freemines", then the bot should create the variable<br> closest mine which is set to 
    the array for bot.freeMines. After that, my bot is supposed to run a for loop that says if the distance between my position and 
    the closest<br> mine is greater than that between my position and the free mines, then it should go searching for free mines. 
    This is useful in the early stages of the match, when my bot<br> needs to collect mines. </p>

    <p> After that, the next section of text relates to going to the tavern. It begins the same as the freeMines section, although 
    now the task it is looking for is "kyrSp33dy" and<br> the variable it is introducing is taverns. This if statement is used to tell 
    my bot exactly which tavern to go to when regenerating health. If my bot was just running about haywire,<br> it would not be good
    at competing, so this if statemnet is essential. </p>

    <p> Finally, we have the task "attacktheplebs". The sole purpose of this if statement is to get my bot to attack other bots. To
    this, I have my bot console.log an action that says<br> the bot's direction should be to find a path to the richest player. Although 
    I could have chosen to have my bot attack the nearest player, I decided that richest player<br> attacks would be far more fruitful. 
    In general, this is how the code for my bot works and makes my bot perform. </p>
    
    <h2 class="head-text"> What did you Learn?</h2>
    
    <p> I learned a couple major things. The first thing that really resonates with me is that I was able to improve my skills with 
    Javascript. This by no means states that I am good<br> at using Javascript, but rather that I better understand how things work. Also, 
    I learned how to persevere through challenges that I may face. During this process, I had to<br> refine my bot, fix miniscule errors 
    such as the misspelling of a single word, and try to compete with my classmates. This simply taught me that even when I don't feel 
    confident,<br> even when I don't feel like the absolute best, it is necessary to just continue doing what you are doing. </p>

<h1>What is Vindinium?</h1>

<p>Vindinium is a turn based online multiplayer game in which four competitors battle to acquire the most land, in the form of mines, and by
doing so, get the most gold. Each player has one person, a hero, who they may move around the map. Players must move around to the various
gold mines placed around the map, and try and take them over. These mines are protected by goblins, and once the goblin is defeated, the 
mine is acquired. When a mine is owned, the owner receives one gold per round from each mine that they hold. <br> Additionally, players 
have the ability to fight against one another, once a single turn is finished. If one hero kills another, and the player who was killed had 
control of a number of mines, then the killer takes over the previously owned mines. Furthermore, if a player wants to regain health which 
may have been lost during battle, they may pay a visit to the tavern. At the tavern, they will be able to buy a drink for the cost of 2 gold. 
The drink will restore 50 health, at most, although they can purchase several drinks at a time. The player who was killed will return to their
spawn point to respawn immediately the game ceases after 1200 total turns, and the winneris decided based upon the final amount of gold that 
players have. </p>

<p> A main goal of the creators of Vindinium was to have people develop unique bots to fight agianst one another. They did this by giving people
certain specifications and guidlines that they needed to follow, and allowing them to design their own bots to fight with. This aspect creates 
really fierce competition. Along with the elo system that works to rank players, Vindinium is a game which induces creativity and a competitive 
nature. </p>

<h1>How is the Bot Created </h1>

<h2> Global Data</h2>
<p>The section which is commented under the title "Global Data" includes information that is needed
for the general well-being of your bot. By this, I mean it includes information that will allow you
create meaningful subsets within your code, as well as introduce new variables into your code, based
upon identifiers already existing in the game. The subset "Global Data" is depicted visually here:</p>
<code><pre> 
  /*                                      *
         * This Code is global data!            *
         *                                      */

        // Set myDir to what you want and it will set bot.goDir to that direction at the end.  Unless it is "none"
        var myDir;
        var myPos = [bot.yourBot.pos.x, bot.yourBot.pos.y];

        var enemyBots = [];
        if (bot.yourBot.id != 1) enemyBots.push(bot.bot1);
        if (bot.yourBot.id != 2) enemyBots.push(bot.bot2);
        if (bot.yourBot.id != 3) enemyBots.push(bot.bot3);
        if (bot.yourBot.id != 4) enemyBots.push(bot.bot4);

        var closestBot = enemyBots[0];
        for (i = 0; i < enemyBots.length; i++) {
            if (bot.findDistance(myPos, [closestBot.pos.x, closestBot.pos.y]) > bot.findDistance(myPos, [enemyBots[i].pos.x, enemyBots[i].pos.y])) {
                closestBot = enemyBots[i];
            }
        }
        //this code is included to have your bot find the nearest enemy bot. This is essential for attacks, although you can adjust as needed. 

        var trumpBot = enemyBots[0];
        for (i = 0; i < enemyBots.length; i++) {
            if (bot.yourBot.mineCount < enemyBots[i].mineCount) {
                trumpBot = enemyBots[i];
            }
        }
        // The purpose of this codeblock is to locate the bot with the most mines. Once that bot is located, my bot will  (hopefully) attack said bot. 
</pre></code>

<p> The first part of global data, which introudces the array "enemyBots", allows for constant identification of
enemies, no matter what bot number you are. This is useful because it allows you to simplify the code you create 
later related to attacking certain enemies. </p>

<p> After that, there is code that introduces the variable "closestBot". As the name says, this variable is needed in order 
to have my bot find the bot that is closest to it. This may be utilised for attacks when you just want to attack someone at
random, when no specific target is needed. </p>

<p> Finally, in this section titled global data, I have the variable "trumpBot". Although the name is slightly silly, it 
does actually relate to the function of the variable. This variable's intention is to attack the bot which has control of
most mines, thus the name "trumpBot". This action is carried out by creating an if statement which basically says that
if my mine count is lower than the enemies bot count, then the varialbe trumpBot needs to come into play. </p>

<h2> What to Do</h2>

<p> The section titled "What to Do" within the code works to tell the bot in what order certain actions. For my bot, I 
wanted regenerating health and killing to be the two main objectives. For this reason, I decided to have my "if" statement
tell the bot to heal, under certain parameters; in my situation, my bot will heal if their health is lower than 30 or (the
two lines stand for Or) if my bot has more than 4 mines and (&&) an enemy is within 7 spaces. </p>

<pre><code>
      /*                                      *
         * This Code Decides WHAT to do         *
         *                                      */
        var task;
        task = "freemines";

        if (bot.yourBot.life <= 30 || bot.yourBot.mineCount > 4 && bot.findDistance(myPos, [closestBot.pos.x, closestBot.pos.y] <= 7)) {
            task = "kyrSp33dy";
        }
        else if (bot.yourBot.life >= 50 && bot.freeMines < 1) {
            task = "attacktheplebs";

        }
        else {
            task = "freemines";

        }

</code></pre>


<p> After that, the next action I want my bot to complete is an attack of other players. Since I will need my bot to
complete 3 actions, I will use an else if statement. The parameters which I will have my bot follow for this istance is 
that they should attack enemy bots if my bot's life is greater than fifty and the number of free mines is less than 1.</p>
    
<p> Finally, when every other actioon is complete, I Will have my bot look for free mines. This will allow it to obtain 
gold, and so my bot will become more wealthy with this action. This set of text is run over and over again until the 
is complete. </p>

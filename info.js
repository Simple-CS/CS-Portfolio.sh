The murder leads Langdon and Neveu down many paths, <br>with danger lurking around every corner, since their dealings left them in contact with shady <br> organizations that little is known about.

If these situations <br> seem as if they may apply to you, then I would absolutely suggest 'How to Not Be Wrong' <br> by Jordan Ellenberg. Ellenberg, a mathematician and professor at University of Wisconsin-Madison, <br> talks all about the mathematical situations we encounter on a daily basis,from out misunderstanding <br> to things we haven't thought about.

It was a read that not only <br> taught me more about math, but it was one that kep me engaged. For any of you out there looking <br> to spend a week or test learning tid-bits of information about real-world applications <br> of mathematical concepts, this is the book for you. ";

The no-holds-barred approach to writing left me constantly entertained and waiting <br> to see what story he would have around the next corner. This book goes from stories about <br> Chinaski's dealings with his abusive and generally awful father, to his exploratory trips with <br> friends and classmates throughout LA. ";

If you enjoy <br> good story telling, humour, a bit of sadness, or just about anything else short of fantasy in <br> your books, then 'Ham on Rye' is for you. It is hard to find much wrong with the book, although <br> I must make it known that the writing is slightly coarse and crude, but wonderful nonetheless.";

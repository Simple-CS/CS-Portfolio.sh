<h1> What is Counter-Strike?</h1>

<p> Counter Strike is a first-person online shooter created by Valve Inc. in the year 1999. 
Although it has had multiple iterations, the current version, Counter Strike: Global-Offensive
is the most popular of all time. With over 10 million monthly users actively participating in
the game, it has a wide international scope. Many things lead to the overall appeal of the game, 
including the majors, skins, and professional teams. This webpage, however, will focus primarily 
on the skin aspect of the game.</p>
    
<h2> Skins</h2>
    
<p> Skins are bought and sold primarily on the Steam Marketplace, which is controlled by Valve. 
The skins may either be dropped at the end of the game, or opened through cases. The skins that 
are dropped in game are free to use by the person who they are dropped to and they may be sold 
the Steam Marketplace, traded to other users, or gambled on a multidude of third party sites. 
Furthermore, due to the market cap of $400, US, on the Steam Market, multiple sites have been 
created in order for people to sell their ultra-rare skins for real money, in the form of Paypal or 
Bitcoin. In terms of obtaining the skins through opening a case, things go as follows: a person
purchases the case initially (cases range from $0.03 to $40.00, dependent on rarity). Once that 
action is completed, the person buys a key for the case. The key may be bought from Steam directly
for $2.50, from sites like OPSkins.com for $2.20, or from various key sellers for about $1.80. 
After the person has both the case and the key, they may open the case. Cases may drop a variety 
weapons ranging in look, price, and rarity.
</p>    

<P> Most of the weapons that have been opened in cases are around $0.11 cents, although the price 
changes as the wear does. To this date, the most expensive weapon sold for real money was $30,000, US,
with many other weapons sold for multiple thousands of dollars. </P>

         <div id="heading-12"><h1>HTML</h1></div>
       
       <div id="paragraph-html"> <p>HyperText Markup Language, more commonly known as HTML, is
        the langauge that is commonly used to create web pages. Web 
        browsers such as Google Chrome use the HTML files in order to 
        create these webpages that can be viewed by people all over the 
        world. Thanks to HTML's method of describing its structure to a
        browser, it is considered a markup language as opposed to being 
        considered a programming language, and in the coding community it
        is considered far more simplistic than other languages. </p>
        
        <p>In order to write HTML code, webpage creators must use these 
        things called tags. In order to dictate that a tag is being used, 
        the person writing the code must place their tag within angle 
        brackets (<em><"tag"></em>). For example, I used the tag "em" in 
        that last sentence in order to italicize the word "tag". Tags have
        the ability to dictate where headings, paragraphs, footers, lists, images, 
        and links shall be placed, as well as emphasize and embolden certain words,
        among other purposes. HTML was created by physicist Tim Berners-Lee
        in the early 1990s as an application for CERN, and was released to the public 
        in 1993, although it is currently on its fifth installment, HTML 5. It was 
        created by Berners-Lee, along with URLs and HTTP, in order to create the backbone 
        of the World Wide Web. HTML is written in elements, which consists of many tags to 
        specify different actions. HTML is essential to the internet, because of its use as 
        the basis for many of the webpages we know today. Without HTML, we may not have many 
        websites we use today. </p></div>
        
        <div id="heading-13"><h1>CSS</h1></div>
       <div id="paragraph-css"> <p>Cascading Style Sheets, more widely known as CSS, is a style language that is used
        to tell a browser how to present a document written in a markup language such as HTML. 
        Commonly, CSS is used as a way to style web pages written in HTML. One of the main purposes
        of CSS is to allow styling to be seperate from the markup language, so that everything is more
        neat and ordered. Some conditions that CSS has the ability to change is the background color
        of a document, the positioning of text and images within a webpage, as well as the borders around 
        bodies of text and images, among other purposes. CSS is not used as a singular language, but rather
        in conjunction with a language like HTML. </p>
            
        <p>CSS is written using a mixutre of ids (which are identified with a # mark preceeding the id name. For example, "#footer-1"),
        classes( identified with ".", for example:".heading"), and HTML tags (like "p" or "h1"). Although the idea of style sheets has 
        been around since the 1980s, in the form of Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), CSS was developed as in order to allow 
        people the use of more style sheets. Similarily to HTML, CSS was developed by a worker for CERN, HÃ¥kon Wium Lie, and the first 
        proposal was given to CERN in 1994. To this day, Lie still works on the advancemnet of CSS use and accessibility, as well as 
        being the Chief Technology Officer of software company "Opera".

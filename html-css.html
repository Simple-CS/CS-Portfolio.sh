       <div id="paragraph-html"> <p> HyperText Markup Language, more commonly known as HTML, is
        the langauge that is<br> commonly used to create web pages. Web 
        browsers such as Google Chrome use the HTML<br> files in order to 
        create these webpages that can be viewed by people all over the 
        world.<br> Thanks to HTML's method of describing its structure to a
        browser, it is considered a markup<br> language as opposed to being 
        considered a programming language, and in the coding<br> community it
        is considered far more simplistic than other languages. </p>

        <p>In order to write HTML code, webpage creators must use these 
        things called tags (which are<br> paired with end tags, notated with a "/" before the desired tag term.) In order<br> to dictate that a tag is being used, 
        the person writing the code must place their tag within<br> angle 
        brackets (<em><"tag"></em>). For example, I used the tag "em" in 
        that last sentence in order to<br> italicize the word "tag". Tags have
        the ability to dictate where headings, paragraphs, footers,<br> lists, images, 
        and links shall be placed, as well as emphasize and embolden certain words,<br>
        among other purposes. Tags are not ever seen by the user, but rahter they 
        tell the browser<br> how to show information on a webpage. HTML was created by
        physicist Tim Berners-Lee<br> in the early 1990s as an application for CERN,
        and was released to the public in 1993,<br> although it is currently on its 
        fifth installment, HTML 5. It was created by Berners-Lee, along<br> with URLs 
        and HTTP, in order to create the backbone of the World Wide Web. HTML is<br> 
        written in elements, which consists of many tags to specify different actions. 
        HTML is essential<br> to the internet, because of its use as the basis for many 
        of the webpages we know today. <br>Without HTML, we may not have many websites we 
        use today. </p></div>

       <div id="paragraph-css"> <p>Cascading Style Sheets, more widely known as CSS, is a style language that is used
        to tell a <br>browser how to present a document written in a markup language such as HTML. 
        Commonly,<br> CSS is used as a way to style web pages written in HTML. One of the main purposes
        of CSS<br> is to allow styling to be seperate from the markup language, so that everything is more
        neat<br> and ordered. Some conditions that CSS has the ability to change is the background color
        of<br> a document, the positioning of text and images within a webpage, as well as the borders<br> around 
        bodies of text and images, among other purposes. CSS is not used as a singular<br> language, but rather
        in conjunction with a language like HTML. </p>

        <p>CSS is written using a mixutre of ids (which are identified with a # mark preceeding the id name.<br> For example, "#footer-1"),
        classes ( identified with ".", for example:".heading"), and HTML tags<br> (like "p" or "h1"). Although the idea of style sheets has 
        been around since the 1980s, in the form<br> of Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), CSS was developed as in order to allow<br> 
        people the use of more style sheets. Similarily to HTML, CSS was developed by a worker for CERN,<br> Hakon Wium Lie, and the first 
        proposal was given to CERN in 1994. To this day, Lie still works on<br> the advancemnet of CSS use and accessibility, as well as 
        being the Chief Technology Officer of <br>software company "Opera". As for the writing of CSS, some of the most improtant keys that 
        are<br> used are squiggly brackets ({}), colons(:), and semi-colons(;), as well as elements like color,<br> height, and border, 
        among others. The "{}" are used to dictate where the style changes for a section<br> begin and end. For example, if I wanted to only
        change something for the heading of a page, I would<br> write "head {(some element written in here)}". This would tell a browser that 
        for the section listed<br> before the brackets, the only att to be changed are those stated <strong>within</strong> the brakcets. 
        Nothing written<br> in this is shown to the viewer of the webpage, but rather the browser translates the attributes to create<br> a visual 
        change that the viewer <strong>does</strong> see.
